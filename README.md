# Items Displayed
Ever thought that there aren't any good ways in Minecraft to show off your stuff? Sure, we have item frames and armor stands, but that's just plain old boring. If you're like me, then you'd prefer having your treasures displayed as 3D models in the world, not cluttering you chests. If that's the case, then let me introduce you to Items Displayed! Designed both for daring adventurers and imaginative builders, this Fabric mod aims to redefine the way you interact with items and decorate your bases.

## Core features
* **Placeable items:** Say goodbye to boring item frames. With Items Displayed, you'll be able to display your items in your base as stunning 3D models! Currently, the mod adds models for all sherds, smithing templates, and ingots. Want more items? Stay tuned for next updates :)
* **Simple mechanics:** My goal is to enhance you gameplay, not to complicate it. You don't need to craft or tweak anything: to place an item, just right-click while holding it, as you would with any vanilla block. Turning your house into a piece of art has never been easier!
* **Item Display:** You may feel like leaving you treasures just lying on the ground is a strange decision. Worry not, this mod also adds a new item called Item Display, which can be made on a Crafting Table using sticks. It works exactly like an Armor Stand... save for the fact it can be rotated to any angle, not just 45 degrees. Currently Item Display supports all sherds and smithing templates.
* **Vanilla style:** When making the mod, I made sure that each model fits seamlessly with Minecraft's signature style. And hey, my mom couldn't tell apart which models are from Minecraft, and which are mine! So sleep tight, the authenticity of vanilla style is kept in place.
* **High compatiblity:** Don't let mod conflicts hold you back from adventures. Items Displayed has been thoroughly tested, so unless another mod makes big changes to the way items work, there shouldn't be any issues.

## FAQ

*Q: Forge version pls :<*

A: I would love to make a Forge version, but I never tried making mods for Forge, so it may take some time. Let's make a deal: I will start creating a Forge version once there are 200,000 downloads on mod's CurseForge page! Sounds good?

*Q: How to offer a feature / submit an issue?*

A: If you want to ask for a cool feature, just go to the comment section on CurseForge, I always try to read the comments! However, if you found an issue, please submit it on GitHub. To find Items Displayed on GitHub, just go to... wait, you're reading this on GitHub. Okay. Cool. Nevermind. 

*Q: Can I add your mod to my modpack?*

A: Yeah, sure, that'd be great! But as always, please leave a link to the mod's CurseForge page, or something like that. And also mention how cool this mod is, but that's, uhhh, optional.

*Minecraft constantly evolves, and so is the mod. In future updates I plan to add more items, including Diamonds, Emeralds, Blaze Rods, Totem of Undying, and much more! Would you like to join me on this adventure?*
